 # Introduction to Statistics


### Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides tools and methods to understand and make sense of large amounts of data to draw conclusions and make decisions based on the data.

###In practice, statistics is used in a wide range of fields, such as business, economics, social sciences, medicine, and engineering. It is used to conduct research studies, analyze market trends, evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and interventions, and make forecasts and predictions.



Examples:

1. Business - Data Analysis(Identifying customer behavior) and Demand Forecasting
2. Medical - Identify efficacy of new medicines(Clinical trials), 
3. Identifying risk factors for diseases(Epidemiology)
4. Government & Politics - Conducting surveys, Polling
5. Environmental Science - Climate research

### Types Statistics

### Descriptive statistics

   #### -> Population vs Sample
   
   #### -> Parameter Vs Statistics 
   
   #### -> Types of Data
   
   #### -> Measure of Central Tendency
   
   #### -> Measure Of Dispersion
   
   #### -> Quantiles and Percentiles
   
   #### -> 5 number Summary

   #### -> Covariance
   
   #### -> Correlation 

   #### -> Random  Variables 

   #### -> Types of Random Variables

           (a). Discrete Random Variable

           (b). Continuous Random Variable
           
   #### -> Probability Distribution 

   #### -> Probability Distribution Functions 

          -> Types of Probability Distribution Functions

                A) Probability Mass Function (PMF)

                B) Probability Density Function

   #### -> Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

   #### -> Density Estimation

   #### -> Parametric Density Estimation

   #### -> Non-Parametric Density Estimation (KDE)

   #### -> Kernel Density Estimate(KDE)

   #### -> Cumulative Distribution Function(CDF) of PMF
